## Weather Wizard

A Machine Learning program which can predict the weather details such as temperature (max and min), humidity, etc provided the past data of the area.
The results look a mess due to NaN values, but by observing we can understand that the NaN values are empty spaces for next predictions.
This was a great learning experience in learning so many various tools and methods.
